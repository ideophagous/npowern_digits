This program calculates the last m digits of any number of the form n^n, with n a positive integer, n>0.
If m is larger than the number of digits of n^n, the remaining positions are filled with 0.

Two files are included: the main program (npowern_digits.py) and the unit testing program (npowern_digits_test.py).
